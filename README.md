Question from group 8:
In today's data-driven political landscape, social media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and engaging potential voters. As political campaigns become increasingly digital, it's more important than ever for candidates to understand where to focus their resources for maximum impact. In this project we aim to provide valuable insights on campaign strategies by identifying the most effective locations to concentrate their social media efforts.

Through the analysis of attributes such as social media engagement, tweet frequency, lack of votes per capita, and engagement scores of political tweets, we will uncover the optimal counties and states, with a particular emphasis on swing states, where campaign efforts could be decisive in determining electoral success. By focusing on key hashtags related to political candidates, such as #trump and #biden, our research will capture real-time engagement during trh 2020 election to offer the most relevant and actionable insights.

The question we formulated is the following:

What are the optimal locations (Counties, states) for candidates to focus on (swing states) regarding social media campaigns w.r.t. things such as social media engagement (tweet frequency of e.g. #trump, #biden), lack of votes per capita, engagement score of political tweets etc. ?"

So given the attributes (within the scope of our project) it will display the most ideal geographical locations. This provides insights on specific targeting when it comes to media campaigns and allows resources to be used more efficiently.
